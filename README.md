# Crypto Go

## Objective
The CryptoGo is an interactive and challenging event designed to engage participants in solving cryptographic and story based puzzles. The primary goal is to test participants' problem-solving skills, teamwork, and cryptographic knowledge within a time-constrained, competitive environment.

## Themes

The Matrix (15 mins): Participants engage in a Matrix-themed challenge involving atbash and Vigenere ciphers, drawing inspiration from the iconic movie.

Space (25 + 5 mins): The challenge explores space-themed ciphers, including Caesar, Fredrici, Autokey, and Alberti, using text, image, and audio clues.

True Crime (30 - 35 mins): Participants become detectives investigating a true crime scenario involving a murder mystery. They analyze evidence, decode ciphers, and unveil hidden truths.

Military Intelligence (40 - 45 mins): The final stage emulates the challenges faced by Allied forces during World War II. Participants decode a letter written in German, solve a Dorabella cipher, and crack an audio-based cipher to reveal crucial coordinates.

##  Ciphers 

Ciphers include Vigenere, Atbash, Caesar, Pigpen, Hash Function, Albertiâ€™s, Antipodal, Chaocipher, Modulo, Fredrichi Window, Autokey cipher, Leetcode/Gamerspeak, Transposition Key, Alien language, Clock Cipher, Egyptian Numbers, Periodic table cipher, and Prime Number Cipher.
